# Catan-Virtual-Reality - Introduction
This project starts with a passion for the famous board game Settlers of Catan, aka CATAN. This game already has a nice appearance and even 3d objects in it like small buildings and plastic mini-roads. In addition to that, our project tries to take the 5 resources (Lumber, Brick, etc) presented on paper cards in the game, and screen them on top of the player's table. Putting more life and realistic feeling to the game.
