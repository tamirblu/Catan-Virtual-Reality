# Catan-Virtual-Reality - Introduction
This project starts with a passion for the famous board game Settlers of Catan, aka CATAN. This game already has a nice appearance and even 3d objects in it like small buildings and plastic mini-roads. In addition to that, our project tries to take the 5 resources (Lumber, Brick, etc) presented on paper cards in the game, and screen them on top of the player's table. Putting more life and realistic feeling to the game.

# 3D Models and Sampling 
Initially, we began the process with 3D models of objects that represent the desired resources, in the process we searched the internet for most suited existing 3D models. Our goal was to represent these models in the form of a graph.

# Projecting the resources
Using the camera matrix and external photo factors, we employed homogeneous coordinates to convert our 3D models into 2D projections on our selected images, utilizing the perspective projection in the homogeneous form method.
